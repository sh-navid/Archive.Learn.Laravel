- Application Layer Protocols
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
        >> Is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. <sup>[mozilla Jan26](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)</sup>
        - HTTP Headers
            - `FIXME: Read about headers later` 
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) 
        >> Is an extension of the `HTTP`. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>   
        >> It uses cryptography for secure communication over a computer network. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>   
        >> In `HTTPS`, the communication protocol is encrypted using `TLS` or, formerly, `SSL`. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>   
        >> The protocol is therefore also referred to as `HTTP over TLS` or `HTTP over SSL`. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>   
        >> `HTTPS` URLs begin with `https://` and use port `443` by default, whereas, `HTTP` URLs begin with `http://` and use port `80` by default. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>   
        >> `HTTP` is not encrypted and thus is vulnerable to `man-in-the-middle` and `eavesdropping` attacks. <sup>[wikipedia Jan26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)</sup>
